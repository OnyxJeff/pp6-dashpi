**DashPi** turns a Raspberry Pi 4b - 4GB into a tiny, stubbornly reliable fullscreen dashboard device. It does exactly one job — displaying your dashboard — and refuses to complain about it.

---

## 🖥️ Installation
- Install Git
```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

- Download repo
```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/OnyxJeff/pp6-dashpi.git
```

---

## 🚦 Optional: Auto Updates & Log Rotation
- Enable update script via cron
```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

- Add:
```bash
# OS-Auto-Updater
  00 01 * * 0 bash $HOME/pp6-dashpi/scripts/update.sh
    # Runs update script at 1am every Sunday
  50 00 1 * * cp $HOME/pp6-dashpi/logs/dashpi.log $HOME/pp6-dashpi/backup_logs/dashpi-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).log
    # Moves weekly update log to "backup_logs" folder on the 1st of the Month at 12:50am
  51 00 1 * * rm -f $HOME/pp6-dashpi/logs/dashpi.log
    # Deletes weekly log from "logs" folder after moving it to "backup_logs" on the 1st of the Month at 12:51am
```

- Enable WiFi watchdog
```bash
# WiFi-Check (every 15 minutes)
  */15 * * * * bash $HOME/pp6-dashpi/scripts/wifi-check.sh
```
> Running every 15 minutes balances reliability and Pi Zero 2W performance.

## 🛠️ Configuration
### ➤ DakBoard URL

- Edit:
```bash
nano $HOME/pp6-dashpi/config/dakboard-url.txt.example
```

Paste in your private DakBoard share URL and save as ```dakboard-url.txt```

### ➤ Refresh Interval

- Edit:
```bash
nano $HOME/pp6-dashpi/config/refresh-interval
```

Specify minutes (e.g., 15).

### ➤ WiFi Watchdog Settings

- Edit:
```bash
nano $HOME/pp6-dashpi/config/wifi-watchdog.conf
```

Set interface name and ping target.

### ➤ Installation

- On the desktop (using RPi connect or VNC) manually change the resolution to 1080p (or your displays native resolution)

- Run setup (installs Chromium, kiosk desktop service, WiFi watchdog)
```bash
cd ~/pp6-dashpi/scripts
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```
> This runs scripts/configs, sets up systemd services for WiFi watchdog, reboots the device, and starts the kiosk automatically.

## 🧹 Uninstalling
```bash
cd ~/pp6-dashpi/scripts
chmod +x uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

- This will remove:
  - systemd services
  - installed scripts and configs
  - kiosk auto-start
  - WiFi watchdog monitor
